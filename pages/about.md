Hello! So yes, my name is Medet Tleukabiluly from Almaty/Kazakhstan


I've been a developer for about 4 years, it might sound small, but density matters, for those 4 years i've been working very hard, learning cool things, testing and learning, my usual days is like sitting ten twelve hours in front of my laptop, writing something, getting inspiration, reverse engineering Github projects, answering Stackoverflow, that's it.


2 years worked remotely, and never got outside of my city Almaty


I'm a self taught developer


In the beginning: At 18 when i was working in underground mines i realized that it's not what i want to do for my life, so i started learning software development.


At 20 while i was working on a tile supermarket called "Stroymart", i wrote a Windows Desktop app that would calculate tile amount for covering bathroom and got some bonus for that, it was my first big achievement, that time i was reading Andrew Troelson "C#" book.


Then i got a job at IT company called "Rating" This was the most important time of my life as i grew faster as developer with that great team. Gained a lot of experience, not just how about code staff, but also how to think.


At 22 i moved with my parents to bigger city called Almaty, where i joined big a lot bigger teams, a lot bigger tasks, a lot bigger fun.


Since then i'm still in Almaty, working and learning every day. My biggest motivation - "Movement is life, and you must grow every time"


My biggest goals are: - Achieve something - Make great products to be proud of - Travel some countries


Hope you enjoy my little story, indeed i have amazing stories about underground mines, childhood, the new city, etc.
